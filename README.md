# Party

Experimenting with [GenStage](https://hexdocs.pm/gen_stage/Experimental.GenStage.html) [PartitionDispatcher](https://github.com/elixir-lang/gen_stage/blob/16337b94d16a21781658c562ac96221886e50194/lib/gen_stage/partition_dispatcher.ex).

### Producer

The Producer generates and returns demand-length lists of randomly generated words. It specifies the [PartitionDispatcher](https://github.com/elixir-lang/gen_stage/blob/16337b94d16a21781658c562ac96221886e50194/lib/gen_stage/partition_dispatcher.ex) with four available partitions and a hash function that dispatches to Consumer partition based on the first letter of the generated word.

### Consumers

Four Consumers are started and subscribed to each available partition that simply wait for words and output them.

The problem is, Consumers never receive any events. ðŸ˜ž
